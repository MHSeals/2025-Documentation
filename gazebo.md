gazebo is a simulation program we use to test our boat!
instead of taking out our boat every time we need to test code, we simply run gazebo!
* at the time of writing (2024), we are using Gazebo Garden. this should come preinstalled with the docker installation

## how to use gazebo
launch gazebo using the command below:
`ros2 launch vrx_gazebo rviz.launch.py`
once you open up gazebo, you'll probably be greeting with a frozen screen. don't worry, this is normal. give it a minute of two :]
